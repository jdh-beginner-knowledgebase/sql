/*
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STORED PROCEDURE IS TO PASS IN A STRING OF COMmA DELIMITED VALUES AND GET THE BEST BUY AND SELL PRICE FROM THE STRING
THE RESULTS SHOW THE DAY NUMBER AND IN BRACKETS THE OPEN PRICE FOR THE DAY
THE FIRST RESULT IS THE BUY PRICE AND THE SECOND RESULT(AFTER THE COMMA) SHOWS THE SELL PRICE
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING VALIDATION E.G:
1. IF BUY AND SELL DATE IS THE SAME WHAT SHOULD BE RETURNED?
2. DO THE VALUES BEING PASSED IN ONLY INCLUDE TRADING DAYS OR SHOULD WE MAKE PROVISION FOR IT?

BELOW ARE TWO EXAMPLES:
1ST VALUE IS THE STRING OF VALUES
2ND VALUE IS THE DELIMITER

Example
EXEC dbo.[GetBestBuyAndSellPrices] '19.15,18.30,18.88,17.93,15.95,19.03,19.00'
